Utilized versions:
------------------

* QGIS 3.16.4
* Ubuntu 18.04
* python 3.6.9

Prerequisites:
--------------

You need a local and valid shp file to add. Because adding a layer to QGIS project means the layer has to be valid.
Therefor we need a dummy. To be flexible on input the appoach chosen is the simple one. Only rule: shp has to be 
named "input.shp".

Big picture:
------------

Everything runs in an Docker container. QGIS is used blank. Means without gui components. Python is invoked to use QGIS libs. Simple QGIS is spawned,
project loaded, layers added to QGIS-workspace and project, project is saved (to the same path where the input shp is stored).

Usage:
------

clone repository:
`https://github.com/simi-so/qgs_creator_mock.git`

walk into folder:
`cd qgs_creator_mock`

build image locally:
`docker build -t qgs_creator_mock:local_dev .`

run image:
`docker run --rm -v <path_to_local_shp>:/data qgs_creator_mock:local_dev`

where `<path_to_local_shp>` is the place where you keep your test shp.

Note:

> Means path of shp needs to be writeable for anybody!

Benchmark:
----------

For benchmarking on unix machines the simple to use GNU tool [time](https://www.gnu.org/software/time/) can be utilized:

`/usr/bin/time -f "time result\ncmd:%C\nreal %es\nuser %Us \nsys %Ss \nmemory:%MKB \ncpu %P" docker run --rm -it --link local_postgis_postgis_1:postgis --net local_postgis_default -v <path_to_local_storeage>:/data qgs_creator_mock:local_dev`

Test layer was the `agi_mopublic_pub.mopublic_grundstueck` table with styling. Adding the styling seems to be complex. So complex style lasts longer. Resulting QGS explodes in size. Here for 500 layers around 37.5Mb.

This results in the following for 500 iterations:

```
time result
cmd:docker run --rm -it --link local_postgis_postgis_1:postgis --net local_postgis_default -v /home/crud3_rt/tmp/:/data qgs_creator_mock:local_dev_qgis3 -v 400 -r 100
real 17.93s
user 0.01s 
sys 0.01s 
memory:58680KB 
cpu 0%
```

> On a System with:
> * i7-8565U CPU (4 cores)

Significant is the DB output while adding DB-Layers to the project. Which means, that added Layers are fetched instantly. This results in upcaling adding time per layer 
plus heavily depends on the content of the layer.
